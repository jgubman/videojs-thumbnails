Video.js Thumbnails
===================
A plugin that allows you to configure thumbnails to display when the user is hovering over the progress bar or dragging it to seek.

Using the Plugin
----------------
The plugin automatically registers itself when you include video.thumbnails.js in your page:

    <script src='videojs.thumbnails.js'></script>

You probably want to include the default stylesheet, too. It handles showing and hiding thumbnails while hovering over the progress bar and a quick animation during the transition:

    <link href="videojs.thumbnails.css" rel="stylesheet">

Once you have your video created, you can activate the thumbnails plugin. In the first argument to the plugin, you should pass an object whose properties are the time in seconds you wish to display your thumbnails. At minimum, you'll need a prerty `0` with a `src`: the thumbnail to display if the user were to hover over the beginning of the progress bar. If you add additional times, they'll partition the progress bar and change the image that is displayed when the user hovers over that area. If you wanted to display one thumbnail for the first five seconds of a video and then another for the rest of the time, you could do it like this:

    video.thumbnails({
      0: {
        src: 'http://example.com/thumbnail1.png'
      },
      5: {
        src: 'http://example.com/thumbnail2.png'
      }
    });
